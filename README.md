# trace-class-neural-networks

This code was used for the numerical experiments in the arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10943, which is part of Torben Sell's PhD thesis.

For the HalfCheetah experiments, one needs a MuJoCo licence (free for students), otherwise the code should work with the required packages. It may be necessary to find good starting points for the algorithm by burning them in for long enough.

Data can be created using the _create_data notebooks found in the create_data directory.

Results can be shown using the _results notebooks, found in the results directory.

Please get in touch with me if you have any questions or struggle to get the code running.
